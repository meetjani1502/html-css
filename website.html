          Virat Kohli stepped down as the Test captain of Team India after India
          lost the Test series against South Africa. He announced his decision
          through social media on January 15. Earlier in 2021, Kohli announced
          to step down as India's T20I captain after the T20 World Cup 2021.
          Rohit Sharma replaced him as India's white-ball captain in December
          2021. As Kohli stepped down from captaincy across all formats of
          cricket, let's take a look at his birth, age, family, education,
          career, stats, net worth, and more.

        Tendulkar" redirects here. For other people with the same surname, see
        Tendulkar (surname). Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar, AO (/Àås åt Én t…õndulk…ôr/
        (listen); pronounced [s…ôt…ïin te…≥…ñulk…ô…æ]; born 24 April 1973) is an
        Indian former international cricketer who captained the Indian national
        team. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsman and cricketer
        in the history of cricket.[4] He is the all-time highest run-scorer in
        both ODI and Test cricket with more than 18,000 runs and 15,000 runs,
        respectively.[5] He also holds the record for receiving the most
        man-of-the-match awards in international cricket.[6] Sachin was a Member
        of Parliament, Rajya Sabha by nomination from 2012 to 2018.[7][8]
        Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test match
        debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of
        sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India
        internationally for over 24 years.[9] In 2002, halfway through his
        career, Wisden ranked him the second-greatest Test batsman of all time,
        behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI batsman of all time,
        behind Viv Richards.[10] The same year, Tendulkar was a part of the team
        that was one of the joint-winners of the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy.
        Later in his career, Tendulkar was part of the Indian team that won the
        2011 Cricket World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for
        India.[11] He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at
        the 2003 World Cup. Tendulkar has received several awards from the
        government of India: the Arjuna Award (1994), the Khel Ratna Award
        (1997), the Padma Shri (1998), and the Padma Vibhushan (2008).[12][13]
        After Tendulkar played his last match in November 2013, the Prime
        Minister's Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna,
        India's highest civilian award.[14][15] He was the first sportsperson to
        receive the reward and, as of 2023, is the youngest
        recipient.[16][17][18] In 2010, Time included Tendulkar in its annual
        list of the most influential people in the world.[19] Tendulkar was
        awarded the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the
        2010 International Cricket Council (ICC) Awards.[20]
